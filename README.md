# Updated-Portfolio

This is an updated portfolio to include my resume and links to applications that I am proud of. I would like to change this some more but since we are just starting to get into some of the good stuff (Node, Express, React), I will wait until I can really spruce this up.

## My Journey

This assignment was relatively easy as I did not have to change much code. The hardest part was not completely redesigning the site with the knowledge that I have gained since my last project. As I learn more I would like to have a new portfolio that is much better designed and a bit prettier.
